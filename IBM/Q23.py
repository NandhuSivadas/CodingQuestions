## ðŸ§® IBM Coding Question â€” *Minimum Moves for Equal Consignments*

### **Problem Statement**

# You are given an array `quantity`, where `quantity[i]` represents the quantity of the *i-th* item type in a shopâ€™s inventory.
# The shopkeeper wants to divide these items into **two non-empty consignments** `T1` and `T2` such that:

# * `T1` contains items from **index 1 to j**
# * `T2` contains items from **index j+1 to n**
# * Both `T1` and `T2` must be **non-empty**
#   (so `1 â‰¤ j < n`)

# The **goal** is to make the **total quantities** of both consignments equal using the **minimum number of moves**.

# ---

# ### **Allowed Move**

# In one move, you can:

# * Increase or decrease the quantity of **any item** by `1`.

# > Note: The quantity of any item must always stay **positive**.

# ---

# ### **Objective**

# Find the **minimum total number of moves** required to make the **sum of T1 equal to the sum of T2**, assuming you can choose the **best split point** `j`.

# ---

# ### **Function Description**

# ```python
# def getMinimumMoves(quantity: list[int]) -> int:
#     """
#     quantity: list of integers representing quantities of each item type
#     Returns: integer, the minimum number of moves to make both consignments equal
#     """
# ```

# ---

# ### **Example 1**

# **Input:**

# ```python
# quantity = [1, 4, 4]
# ```

# **Output:**

# ```
# 1
# ```

# **Explanation:**
# Possible splits:

# * Split at `j = 1` â†’
#   `T1 = [1]`, `T2 = [4, 4]`
#   Sum difference = `|1 - 8| = 7` â†’ 7 moves needed

# * Split at `j = 2` â†’
#   `T1 = [1, 4]`, `T2 = [4]`
#   Sum difference = `|5 - 4| = 1` â†’ **1 move needed**

# âœ… **Minimum moves = 1**

# ---

# ### **Example 2**

# **Input:**

# ```python
# quantity = [5, 3, 2, 6]
# ```

# **Output:**

# ```
# 0
# ```

# **Explanation:**

# * Split at `j = 2`:
#   `T1 = [5, 3]` â†’ Sum = 8
#   `T2 = [2, 6]` â†’ Sum = 8
#   Both sums already equal â†’ **0 moves needed**

# âœ… **Minimum moves = 0**

# ---

# ### **Constraints**

# * `2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5`
# * `1 â‰¤ quantity[i] â‰¤ 10^9`

# ---
